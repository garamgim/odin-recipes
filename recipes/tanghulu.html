    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tanghulu is a popular candied fruit snack popular throughout northern China. This Chinese street food is
        different from
        a traditional candied fruit. <br>Instead of a soft candied fruit, the hardened sugar syrup creates a hard
        crunchy shell
        around the fruit. It is served on a long bamboo skewer. <br>If you were wondering how to make tanghulu, you have
        come to the
        right place!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Strawberries or other fruit of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and pat dry strawberries or fruit of choice.</li>
        <li>Arrange fruit on bamboo skewer. I recommend 1-3 pieces per skewer.</li>
        <li>Bring water and sugar mixture to a boil.</li>
        <li>Using candy thermometer, boil sugar water mixture until the temperature reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit. This
            will take
            approximately 5-10 minutes. <br>If you do not have a candy thermometer, you can test the temperature by
            dipping
            a spoon into
            cold ice water and then dipping the spoon into the syrup. <br>If it hardens immediately, then you have
            reached
            the proper
            temperature.</li>
        <li>When sugar water mixture has reached the desired temperature, dip your fruit skewer into the sugar mixture
            to coat the
            fruit.</li>
        <li>Place each fruit skewer on your sheet pan, silicone baking sheet or parchment paper. <br>If you parchment
            paper
            is not good
            quality, your candy may stick to the paper. You can spray parchment paper with pan spray to help prevent
            sticking.</li>
        <li>Sugar coating should harden almost immediately. This recipe is best eaten right away. If you need to store,
            cover
            lightly with plastic wrap and store in refrigerator.
