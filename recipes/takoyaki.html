    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Takoyaki is one of the most popular street snacks in Japan, aside from yakisoba noodles and onigiri rice balls.
        <br>Little roadside stalls can be found everywhere, ready to serve up a batch of takoyaki when you need it most.
        <br>But for the freshest, tastiest takoyaki, the best thing to do is to make it yourself.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>450ml Dashi stock</li>
        <li>140g Flour</li>
        <li>10g Cornstarch or Cornflour</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>140g Octopus pieces</li>
        <li>Takoyaki Sauce</li>
        <li>Katsuobushi</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the octopus into bite-size pieces then pop aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the plain flour and cornstarch in a bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the egg. <br>Add the egg to the
            dry mixture,
            then slowly pour in the dashi stock or water and whisk it all together. <br>You're aiming for a thin, runny
            consistency
            here, so if it's too thick just add more water or dashi.</li>
        <li>Now, heat the takoyaki pan over a medium high heat and brush oil over the entire surface. <br>Pour the
            batter
            into the
            centre of the pan and keep pouring until all the wells are full and the batter covers the entire plate.</li>
        <li>Place one piece of octopus into each well. When the bottom of the batter starts turning crispy, use a
            chopstick to cut out a square shape around each
            takoyaki well.</li>
        <li>Move your chopstick in an ‘L’ shape around the each well, then immediately push down into the well to flip
            the batter,
            forming a rough ball shape as you go. <br>It might take a few tries, but keep going and you’ll quickly get
            the hang of it.</li>
        <li>Continue flipping each ball occasionally as the batter becomes crispy and golden brown on all sides.</li>
        <li>Top with takoyaki sauce and mayonnaise in a zigzag pattern. Dust with katsuobushi.</li>
    </ol>
